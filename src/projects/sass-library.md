### What I Did

Designed a css library where I:

- Utilized variables to make a modular grid system.
- Included different utility styles.
- Reduced the size of the css file by purging unused styles in the current project

### What I Learned

From this project, I learned:

- How to create styles and components for individual projects
- The basic idea of how other css libraries work
