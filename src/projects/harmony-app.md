### What I Did

Developed a full stack android app where I:

- Worked on a team of 5 to deliver a product to our client at the end of 4 two week sprints.
- Implemented the chat funcitonality by creating the database tables, creating the backend, and designing the front end interface.
- Redesigned the chat page interface upon client request.
- Improved query performance by rewriting our to a single query instead of multiple.
- Participated in daily scrum meetings to ensure project requirements were being met.

### What I Learned

From this project, I learned:

- How to handle a missed deadline on a sprint.
- How to discover bugs by diving into a problem and analyzing it in pair programming activities.
- How to communicate requirements to peers and prioritize tasks.
- How to work with a peer to connect frontend and backend code that were written at different times.
- The importance of documentation and consistent naming conventions.
- The importance of caution when editing delicate pieces of code.
