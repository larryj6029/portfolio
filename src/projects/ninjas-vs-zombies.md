### What I Did

Developed a 2d web game where I:

- Worked on a team of 4 where we used Scrum and Agile methodologies to deliver a product at the end of 4 two week iterations.
- Designed a garbage collection system that reduced the number of entities in the game to 25 compared to the original where it would keep increasing.
- Developed a level generator that would change the layout with random item and enemies spawn so the user had a unique experience each game.
- Designed the level generator so that it would be easy to add assets for different levels.

### What I Learned

From this project, I learned:

- How to use a game engine to update a sprite with different physics properties.
- How to measure performance of an app.
- How to determine how often the garbage collection algorithm would run.
- Various game development techniques like animation, level generation, physics, and design.
- How to efficiently assign tasks and keep consistent communicaiton with teammates.
